# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Challenge

### Purpose of the PyBer Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis was to inspect and merge data to show the correlation between city types, number of drivers, and number of riders to the fare costs and drivers by types of cities. We then created visualizations to help PyBer ways to improve upon costs and access. 

## Results

### Outline of Differences

When looking at the summary you almost immediately notice how different the numbers are for each city type. The urban city type has the highest numbers for totals (total rides, drivers, and fares) but suburban comes in second, and the rural areas have the lowest. When it comes to average fares per ride and per driver, rural cities have the highest, suburban maintained second, and urban comes in 3rd. Third place for Urban in this category happens to be the best place to be in. I would attribute this to the population and the distances traveled.

## Summary

### Recommendations for Ride Sharing

There are three recommendations I have for the CEO of Pyber. First one would be more marketing to the rural communities. Be rural cities have lower populations and farther distances to travel, marketing might help reach more people. With that comes being able to lower fares. The second recommendation would be to raise fares in urban cities. Since Pyber is needed in places like NYC, they would go with the change and in turn, make more money. My final recommendation would be that the look at the needs of each city type. Rural could be on the lower end of the spectrum for total rides because there might now be enough drivers for more rides. Since the fares tend to be higher in the rural cities, that would cover the cost of new drivers.
